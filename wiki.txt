== Introduction ==
You can install this addon from: [https://www.urepo.org URepo Repository]
<br />
<br />
The URepo Helper addon allows you to automatically install the addons in your collection on your Kodi installation. Simply enter your username in the addon settings and then run the script and it will display the list of addons that you have added to your collection on the [https://www.urepo.org URepo] site. You can then select to have them all installed, or reduce your selection to only a few addons that you wish to install.
